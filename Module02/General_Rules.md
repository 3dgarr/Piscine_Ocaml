# 🚀 OCaml Piscine Guidelines

## 📌 General Rules

* Every output goes to the **standard output** and ends with a **newline**, unless specified otherwise.
* 📂 **Follow the exact filenames** as required, including class names, function names, and method names.
* ❌ **Forbidden keywords**: `open`, `for`, and `while`. Using them is considered **cheating**, no exceptions.
* 📁 **Turn-in directories**: `ex00/`, `ex01/`, ..., `exn/`.
* 📖 **Read the examples carefully**—they may include hidden requirements!
* ⛔ **Only use OCaml syntaxes** covered in the piscine. Additional syntaxes, modules, and libraries are **forbidden**, unless explicitly allowed.

## 📜 Exercise Submission

* ✅ **Exercises must be completed in order**.
* 🛑 The grading stops at the **first failed exercise**—old school rules apply.
* 🧐 **Read each exercise fully before starting**. Yes, really, **read it all**!
* 🛠️ **Compiler to use**: `ocamlopt`.
* 🏗️ If an exercise requires a function, **provide everything needed to compile a full executable**.
* 🧪 The executable should include **test cases** proving your solution works.
* ❌ **Avoid using `;;` in files**—it’s only for the interpreter.
* 🤖 The interpreter is **your best friend**, master it early!

## ⏳ Deadlines & Evaluation

* ⚠️ **Subjects may change** up to **4 hours** before the final turn-in time.
* 🖊️ **No coding style is enforced**, but keep your code **readable** for peer evaluators.
* 📏 **Big functions = bad style**. Keep it clean and modular.
* ❌ **You won’t be graded by an automated program**, unless explicitly stated.
* 🎯 Some piscine days **may enforce strict output formats**—follow them **precisely**.
* 📂 **Only required files should be present** in the repository during peer evaluation.

## 🧠 Final Advice

* [ ]  🤔 Even short exercises **deserve careful thought**—ensure you understand them fully.
* [ ]  ⚡ **Think before coding!**
* [ ]  🔥 By Odin, by Thor! **Use your brain!** 🛡️⚔️
