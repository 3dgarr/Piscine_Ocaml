# 📅 Day-Specific Rules

* 🧩 Some themes in this module can be **challenging**. **Practice as much as you can**—they are used frequently in the Piscine.
* 🧬 The genetics part is **not as hard as it seems**—**stay calm, take a deep breath, and tackle it step by step**.
* 🔍 **Functional programming is mandatory**. Your code **MUST** follow a functional style (except for input/output side effects). **Failure to do so will lead to a tough defense session**.
* 🏗️ **For EVERY exercise, provide a full program** that includes **sufficient test cases** to prove your solution works.
* 🔄 **Starting from exercise 05**, each new exercise **must embed** the code from previous exercises:
  * [ ]  `ex06` includes `ex05`
  * [ ]  `ex07` includes `ex05` and `ex06`
  * [ ]  And so on...
